# In-A-Week

Learning Data Structures and Algorithms is overwhelming, but with proper guidance and plan it can be made simpler.😎🤓

Programming Club x DSC Ahmedabad University introduce #InAWeek Series for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. 🥳🥳 In one week, we'll pick a DSA topic, share handpicked resources 📖 and problems and facilitate you with live sessions and doubt solving 💡. Everything will be beginner-friendly and we are assuming no prior knowledge other than programming. 👨‍💻👩‍💻

We're designing this to help you build your foundation for your placements 💼. We have planned things on a day-to-day basis. You just have to show up and do it! So bring your friends along and make the most out of this opportunity.🎉🤩

We're accepting registrations for first two weeks starting 28th December, where we'll cover Linked Lists and Recursion 🔗⛓️

We'll be sharing the resources every day on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xu2KmZPhdk). Refer to "DSA #IN-A-WEEK" category once you join in. 

We'll invite some of you guys to lead our doubt sessions where you can explain your approach towards a problem. As it is said, the best way to learn is to teach others. Also by explaining the problem to your peers you'll gain an edge while explaining it to your recruiter in interviews. If this sounds interesting to you, keep sharing your progress in #progress-sharing channel.

Everything will be uploaded on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Programming-Club-Ahmedabad-University/In-A-Week) repository as well.
